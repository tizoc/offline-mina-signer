# Offline Mina Message Signer

## ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: USE AT YOUR OWN RISK ‚ö†Ô∏è

**IMPORTING YOUR SEED PHRASE INTO THIS SCRIPT CAN BE VERY DANGEROUS.**
- Your **seed phrase** is the master key to all your accounts and funds. If it is exposed, anyone can gain full access to your assets.
- Running this script on a compromised or online machine increases the risk of your seed phrase being leaked.
- Only use this script **offline** on a secure, trusted device.

### Best Practices:
1. **Do not use your main wallet seed phrase.** Create a test wallet with a new seed phrase for experimenting with this script.
2. **Run the script offline.** Disconnect from the internet before running the script to reduce the risk of unauthorized access.
3. **Delete the script and any temporary files immediately after use.**
4. **Understand the risks** before proceeding.

## Overview

This application derives Mina-compatible private and public keys from a mnemonic and signs messages offline. It uses the `mina-signer` library for generating and verifying Mina keys and signatures.

## Features

- Derive Mina private and public keys from a mnemonic.
- Sign messages offline with the derived private key.
- Verify signed messages.

## üö® **Recommended Setup** üö®

To run this script inside a disposable Docker container, follow the **[Docker Guide](docker-guide.md)**.  
This guide includes step-by-step instructions for setting up and running the script offline in a more isolated, disposable environment to protect sensitive data.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Security Notice** ‚ö†Ô∏è

Setting up and running this script directly on the host machine is **strongly discouraged**. Here's why:

### üõë Risks of Running on the Host
- **Compromised Dependencies**: If any `npm` dependency is compromised or malicious, it could gain access to your sensitive data, including your mnemonic and private keys.
- **Persistent Environment**: Once installed on your host machine, dependencies or files may linger even after you finish running the script, increasing the risk of leaks or breaches.

### ‚úÖ Why Docker Is Safer
Using the Docker setup ensures:
1. **Isolated Environment**: All dependencies are installed in a disposable, isolated container that is separate from your host machine.
2. **Ephemeral Setup**: The container is deleted after use (`--rm` flag), leaving no trace of your mnemonic, keys, or any installed dependencies on your system.
3. **Minimal Risk**: Even if an `npm` dependency is compromised, it operates only within the isolated Docker environment, reducing the risk of affecting your host machine or other applications.

### üîí **Recommendation**
To maximize security, always use the **[Docker Guide](docker-guide.md)** to set up and run this script inside a disposable Docker container. Avoid running it directly on your host machine.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **If You Decide to Go Without Docker...**

Running this script directly on the host machine is not recommended due to the risks outlined above. However, if Docker cannot be used and proceeding without it is necessary, follow the following instructions carefully.

- Ensure the machine is online **only while installing dependencies** and disconnect from the internet **before running the script**.
- Use a trusted, secure environment with minimal risk of malware or compromise.
- Avoid using a sensitive or primary mnemonic.

**Proceed with caution.**

## Prerequisites

- Node.js.
- NPM or Yarn installed on your system.

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

---

## Usage

Run the application using the following command:

```bash
node index.mjs "your mnemonic" "optional message"
```

By default, the account index is set to `0`. To specify a different account index, pass it as a third parameter:

```bash
node index.mjs "your mnemonic" "optional message" 3
```

By default, the account don't have passphrase. To specify passphrase pass it as a forth parameter:

```bash
node index.mjs "your mnemonic" "optional message" 0 "your passphrase"
```

### Example

1. **Derive Keys Only**:
   ```bash
   node index.mjs "abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon about" 
   ```
   **Output**:
   ```
   Mina Public Key: B62qpqCoBci3mKNrfCnLkKS2SSV9QyrPbPBABe4stVWnRRfkG8sn3t4
   ```

2. **Sign a Message**:
   ```bash
   node index.mjs "abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon about" "hello mina"
   ```
   **Output**:
   ```
   Mina Public Key: B62qpqCoBci3mKNrfCnLkKS2SSV9QyrPbPBABe4stVWnRRfkG8sn3t4
   Message: hello mina
   Signature field: 9052086882362500211121293548326467096160846808525301576969879446919825085086
   Signature scalar:    15338095341319804139308033170764314134470035736709448089680152939796145172060
   Message verified: true
   ```
