# Offline Mina Message Signer

## ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: USE AT YOUR OWN RISK ‚ö†Ô∏è

**IMPORTING YOUR SEED PHRASE INTO THIS SCRIPT CAN BE VERY DANGEROUS.**
- Your **seed phrase** is the master key to all your accounts and funds. If it is exposed, anyone can gain full access to your assets.
- Running this script on a compromised or online machine increases the risk of your seed phrase being leaked.
- Only use this script **offline** on a secure, trusted device.

### Best Practices:
1. **Do not use your main wallet seed phrase.** Create a test wallet with a new seed phrase for experimenting with this script.
2. **Run the script offline.** Disconnect from the internet before running the script to reduce the risk of unauthorized access.
3. **Delete the script and any temporary files immediately after use.**
4. **Understand the risks** before proceeding.

## Overview

This application derives Mina-compatible private and public keys from a mnemonic and signs messages offline. It uses the `mina-signer` library for generating and verifying Mina keys and signatures.

## Features

- Derive Mina private and public keys from a mnemonic.
- Sign messages offline with the derived private key.
- Verify signed messages.

## üö® **Recommended Setup** üö®

To run this script inside a disposable Docker container, follow the **[Docker Guide](docker-guide.md)**.  
This guide includes step-by-step instructions for setting up and running the script offline in a more isolated, disposable environment to protect sensitive data.

---

## Prerequisites

- Node.js.
- NPM or Yarn installed on your system.

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

---

## Usage

Run the application using the following command:

```bash
node index.mjs "your mnemonic" "optional message"
```

By default, the account index is set to `0`. To specify a different account index, pass it as a third parameter:

```bash
node index.mjs "your mnemonic" "optional message" 3
```

By default, the account don't have passphrase. To specify passphrase pass it as a forth parameter:

```bash
node index.mjs "your mnemonic" "optional message" 0 "your passphrase"
```

### Example

1. **Derive Keys Only**:
   ```bash
   node index.mjs "abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon about" 
   ```
   **Output**:
   ```
   Mina Public Key: B62qpqCoBci3mKNrfCnLkKS2SSV9QyrPbPBABe4stVWnRRfkG8sn3t4
   ```

2. **Sign a Message**:
   ```bash
   node index.mjs "abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon about" "hello mina"
   ```
   **Output**:
   ```
   Mina Public Key: B62qpqCoBci3mKNrfCnLkKS2SSV9QyrPbPBABe4stVWnRRfkG8sn3t4
   Message: hello mina
   Signature field: 9052086882362500211121293548326467096160846808525301576969879446919825085086
   Signature scalar:    15338095341319804139308033170764314134470035736709448089680152939796145172060
   Message verified: true
   ```
